# Countries Explorer

This project was done to fetch informations from an API (restcountries.com) once the user choose the country that he want to know.

I used a single HTML page for structuring and CSS for styling. 
I used JavaScript to collect, filter, and map out all the data, including flags, languages, country capitals (I learned South Africa has three! ), and map links.

I hope you have enjoyed!
